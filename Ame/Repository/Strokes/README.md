<p align="center"><span style="color:286c33" class="dict18">SOD and SODA License Agreement</span>
<br>as of July 24, 2007 modified on January 1, 2012 - 3rd Public Release
</p><hr style="width:96.5%">
 
<p><span class="dict24">EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2012:</span><br>
The first LIMITATION of the license below is no longer required for the set of 1,654 SODs and SODAs, but recommended.



</p><p><span class="dict24">PREAMBLE</span><br>
These diagrams exist because of an enormous effort and at great
personal sacrifice in terms of time and income of several persons.
Ownership of these diagrams is not taken lightly, nor should the
privilege of their free use be taken lightly.  The benefits of using
these diagrams comes with the responsibility of compliance with this
license.  Your responsible use makes future public release of larger
collections tenable.

</p><p><span class="dict24">PLEASE READ: THIS GRANT OF LICENSE HAS CHANGED (3rd LICENSE  VERSION)</span><br>
Each new public release of diagrams from the SODER project has its own
unique grant of license.  With increasing investments of time and money
into the project, this most recent grant of license intends to make more
clear to the public how to freely use the diagrams while protecting
owner's copyright.  This license applies to the public release of the
archive whose members constitute 1,654 GIF89a formatted stroke order
diagram animations (SODAs) and 1,654 PNG formatted static stroke order
diagrams (SODs).  This release of the 1,654, supplants and replaces the
experimental public release of the first 500 SODs and 500 SODAs created
by the Stroke Order Diagram Editor-Retrographer (SODER), and also
replaces the public release which followed containing 1,000 SODs and
1,000 SODAs. You should completely replace the older sets with this new
one. Many of the 1,000 previously released SODs and 1,000 SODAs have
been reedited and improved.

</p><p><span class="dict24">COMMERCIAL LICENSE NOTICE</span><br>
Please note that this license does not apply
to PRINT MEDIA or commercial use.  You MUST have a commercial license to
use these diagrams in any product which you will sell or otherwise
financially benefit from.  Rolomail Trading, James Rose, and The Kanji
Cafe specifically reserve the exclusive right to use these diagrams in
books or other printed media sold to the public unless you have explicit
permission, or a commercial license.  Commercial license will be granted
inexpensively, so do not hesitate to inquire.  For example:  Permission
has been granted to one publisher to use no more than 4 of the diagrams
in a book at no cost as the book deals with Japanese teaching methods.
Permission to use 177 of the diagrams was denied to a book author whose
work was devoted to teaching Japanese kanji because he has yet to pursue
a commercial license for use with the book he was writing despite the
book being a commercial project.  If you see these diagrams being used
on the web or in a book, and do not see the name of the person or
organization/ website using the diagrams listed here, they are not
otherwise authorized, and we would appreciated being notified.

</p><p><span class="dict24">GRANT OF LICENSE</span><br>
License is hereby granted to use these 1,654 Stroke
Order Diagrams (SODs) and or 1,654 Stroke Order Diagram Animations
(SODAs) on websites or in offline, non-commercial software such as
free-ware, subject to each of these SIX specific LIMITATIONS:

</p><ol>
<li>YOU MUST PROVIDE A LINK TO YOUR WEBSITE, or software product which
intends to use the diagrams, which then must appear on public display at
the license page at www.kanjicafe.com/license.htm before your use is
legal and compliant.  Use of the 3rd public release of 1,654 kanji is
unauthorized unless you have provided valid link information to
KanjiCafe.com and it is subsequently on public display.  To have your
website linked to from the license page, and thereby comply with the
license agreement, send the URL of your site or product to "jim (at)
kanjicafe.com".  If you are upgrading from the 2nd public release of
1,000 kanji, you must comply with this limitation (1) before using the
new 1,654 kanji set.

<p>(This provision has been added to help familiarize the public with
products and websites which make use of the project's SODAs and SODs
in a legal manner, as well as to help promote legal use of the diagrams
and animations in accordance with this license.)

<p><span class="dict24">Notes:</span><br>

</p><p>Where in previous releases it would have been appreciated if anyone
using the first 1,000 SODs or SODAs as a courtesy would have notified
Jim Rose at jim(at)kanjicafe.com, with the 3rd public archival release
of the first 1,654 completed SODs and SODAs, it is now a license
requirement in compliance with limitation (1).

</p><p>Many of stroke order diagrams in this current release are the only kanji
stroke order diagrams available for that particular kanji to the general
public.  i.e., there is no reference with which to dispute the joint
opinion of the artist and editor.  In each case the artist and editor
have referenced other kanji diagrams which contain the same radical
elements, and are backed up by known public references to ensure
accurate depictions of the correct order.

</p><p>The SODER project's goal is to create SODs for each of the 6,353 kanji
in JIS X 0208-1990. The SODs are used to automatically create SODAs. In
choosing which kanji to work on for these first 1,654 there has been no
attempt to encompass any particular well defined subset of chinese
characters. However, they are all from the more "important" 1/3rd of the
JIS X 0208-1990 set. Note that none of the kanji in this release exceed
15 strokes. We plan to make another, larger public release of new
diagrams and animations at the milestones of every 500 characters, or 12
public releases before the final set is published.  This is the 3rd
public release.

</p><p>Each SOD diagram is in PNG format and each SODA animation is in GIF89a
format.  Both are named by the kanji, in this form:

</p><p>&lt;kanji&gt;.png

</p><p>and . . .

</p><p>&lt;kanji&gt;.gif

</p><p>These archive files are named by the kanji encoded as either EUC-JP
(Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) or Unicode (Mac OS X):
